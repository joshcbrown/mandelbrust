# mandelbrot-rs

This is a rewrite of an [old project](https://github.com/joshcbrown/mandelbrot) in Rust. The old one was written in Python,
so this code is much more performant, seeing anywhere from 10-20x speed increase
based on extremely un-scientific testing.

Hoping to eventually build out a GUI explorer, because image generation now only 
takes around a second, so it might be fun to have be able to actually travel around 
the set visually.
